This is an AI-generated version of my Powerball NUmber Generator. The following is the prompt I used:

I want to build a single-page web app that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I want the app to be called "Random Powerball Number Generator". This should also appear as the header of the web-app. The text right under the header should read: "Play at your own risk. We cannot guarantee any numbers will be accurate." Centered underneath this, I want a clickable button that reads: "Generate my numbers!". I want this button to be styled in a way that it is a rectangle-shaped button that is solid red. I want the text within the red button to be white. Upon clicking the button, I want the page to now display the numbers: 05, 24, 28, 58, and 14. I want the numbers to each be displayed within a circle, with the first 4 being in a black-outlined white circle, with black text. The 5th number should be displayed in a solid red circle, with white text. underneath the displayed numbers, I want a solid green button that reads: "Bad vibes. I want new numbers!" Upon clicking the green button, I want the page to now display: "Well, that’s too damn bad! You get what you get, and you don't throw a fit!" I want this to be structured in a way that there is only one html file to paste it into my "index.html" file and run. I want the font to be Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif. I want the size of the header/title to be 75pt, the warning: "Play at your own risk. We cannot guarantee any numbers will be accurate." should be 50pt, and all other fonts that appear to be 50pt. Upon the last message being displayed ("Well, that’s too damn bad! You get what you get, and you don't throw a fit!"), I want a clown-face emoji to also appear. If you need any clarifications or have any questions, be sure to ask me before you start generating any code.<img width="468" height="301" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad294824-9526-4c4b-9598-b91cf6b598e3" />
